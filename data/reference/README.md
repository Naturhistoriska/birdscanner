Folder `fasta_files` contains aligned data in fasta format.

Folder `selected` is a selection of data from the
`fasta_files` folder, where folder
`birdscanner/data/reference/selected/hmm` contains hmm's
based on a slection of the fasta files in `fasta_files`.

The file `selected_shortlabel.degap.fas` is the collection
of sequences in all the files in `fasta_files` that was
used to produce the hmm's.
